                                This was my second major programming project.  I started on this during the first half of my senior year of high school.  Having had so much success with my previous programming project, I decided to try stretching my skills to see how far I could go.  I decided to try to figure out 3D graphics.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I knew how to draw lines to the screen, so I figured that would be enough to at least be able to draw wireframe objects.  I started out trying to render a simple wireframe cube.  My initial approach was to use all kinds of fancy trig functions to calculate a position on a screen.  It worked, kind of.  The result didn't quite look right, and trying to move the camera caused everything to break.  
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>

                                I continued messing around untill I came across a much simpler function that would make it all work.
                                </p>

                                After getting tired of messing with primatives, I tried building a first person platformer, with a grid based approach I was already familiar with.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                I tried messing with height maps and slopes.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>

                                This project later helped me through calc 3, as it allowed me to visualize 3D functions.  
                                </p>

                                I did very little research while building this project.  Since then I have learned and worked with OpenGL and learned about the processes involed with modern graphics.
